# Only build pull requests with git-flow

This is a CircleCI Orb that builds only pull requests or specific branches.

## Motivation

Circle CI has "Only build Pull requests" option. But that build default branch without pull requests.
So "Master Branch" does not build. It is incompatible with  git-flow.
